# Pack Tool

Pack Tool combines the singular textures from Minecraft texture packs into atlases, and vice-versa.

Pack Tool is designed for texture artists who find dealing with many individual files tedious. It is particularly useful for creating resourcepacks that override the textures in modded content (which is often the case if you don't use vanilla textures).

# Features

Pack Tool can read resourcepacks in zip or directory form. You can then perform the following actions:

* Export atlases for easy editing
* Import edited atlases
* Split (export) edited atlases to a resourcepack
* View original & edited atlasses
* Merge packs (useful for updating)

Atlases are created for each type (block, item, entity, etc.) in each namespace (minecraft/modid).

Atlases are much easier to work with, removing the need to open multiple files in an image editor.
